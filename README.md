# debugmenu-imgui
Dear ImGui implementation for aap's debugmenu

## Supported games:
GTA 3 1.0 US (support for VC and SA will be added later)

## How to use:
Download the latest release from the releases page and copy debugmenu.dll to your game folder (next to the exe). Make sure you have a plugin that uses it. 
Plugins that used aap's debugmenu are fully compatible with this as this is intended to be a replacement for it.

## How to build:
Setup plugin-sdk and build using the solution in the project-files folder

## Thanks to:

aap (for the original debugmenu)

ermaccer (for his d3d9 hook and ImGui implementation)
